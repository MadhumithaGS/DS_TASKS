1. 100-word Write-up on Machine Learning
	Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions 
without being directly programmed for every task. Instead of following fixed rules, machines recognize patterns, make 
predictions, and get better with experience—just like humans do. We see machine learning everywhere today: in photo recognition,
 language translation, online recommendations, fraud alerts, and even self-driving cars. By processing huge amounts of information, 
it helps solve problems quickly and accurately. As the technology grows, it continues to shape fields like healthcare, finance,
 manufacturing, and communication, making our world smarter and more automated.

2. Applications of Machine Learning

	Machine learning is widely used in many fields. Major applications include:

	Image and speech recognition

	Natural Language Processing (chatbots, translations)

	Healthcare diagnosis and prediction

	Fraud detection in banking

	Stock market trend prediction
